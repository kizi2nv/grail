  grounded in the Constitution, statutes such as the Administration of Criminal
  Justice Act (ACJA) 2015, and international human rights instruments. These
  protections ensure fair treatment during arrest, detention, and trial while
  addressing systemic issues like police brutality and coerced confessions.

#### **1. Right to Dignity and Freedom from Torture**

*Section 34* of the **1999 Constitution of Nigeria** prohibits torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment. This is reinforced by *Section 8* of the **ACJA 2015**, which expressly forbids torture, intimidation, or inhumane treatment during arrest and interrogation.

#### **2. Right to Legal Representation**

*Section 36(6)(c)* of the **Constitution** and Section 17 of the **ACJA** provide that a suspect is entitled to legal representation at all stages of their case. If a suspect cannot afford a lawyer, the Legal Aid Council or another authorized entity should provide one. In *Kabiru v. A.G Ogun State*, the court discussed the importance of ensuring that legal counsel is present during confessional statements. 

#### **3. Right to Remain Silent**

*Section 35(2)* of the **Constitution** gives a suspect the right to remain silent until they have consulted their lawyer. This right was explored in *Daniel Sugh v. The State (1988)*, where the court clarified that a suspect's silence cannot be used as an admission of guilt but must be protected as a fundamental right.

#### **4. Protection Against Arbitrary Detention**

*Section 35(4)* of the **Constitution** mandates that a suspect be brought before a court within 24 to 48 hours, depending on the proximity of the court. Failure to adhere to this time frame renders the detention unconstitutional, as demonstrated in *Mrs. Lufadeju v. Evangelist Bayo Johnson (2007)*. 

#### **5. Right to be Informed of Charges**

Under *Section 35(3)* of the **Constitution**, a suspect must be informed promptly, in a language they understand, of the reasons for their arrest. This aligns with international standards like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

#### **6. Protection Against Coerced Confessions**

*Section 29(2)* of the **Evidence Act 2011** disallows the use of confessions obtained through oppression or inducement. The court's ruling in *The State v. Jimoh Salawu (2011)* exemplifies the strict tests applied to ensure confessions are voluntary.

#### **7. Right to Bail**

*Section 30* of the **ACJA** and judicial precedents grant suspects the right to apply for bail, particularly for non-capital offences. In *McLaren v. Jennings (2003)*, the court criticized the misuse of detention as a tool for debt recovery, emphasizing bail as a remedy for unjustifiable detention.

#### **8. Right to Interpretation**

*Section 17(3)* of the **ACJA** stipulates that an interpreter must be provided when a suspect does not understand English. However, concerns have been raised about the lack of a clear definition of who qualifies as an interpreter, potentially undermining this safeguard.

#### **9. Right to Privacy**

*Section 37* of the **Constitution** protects a suspectâ€™s right to privacy during investigations. This includes limits on search and seizure actions, ensuring they are conducted lawfully and with respect for personal dignity.

#### **10. Right to a Fair Hearing**

*Section 36* of the **Constitution** guarantees a suspect the right to an impartial trial within a reasonable time. This right includes access to evidence against them and the opportunity to challenge it in court.

#### **11. Obligation to Record Interrogations**

The **ACJA** requires police to electronically record interrogations to enhance transparency. However, implementation is limited by a lack of facilities, such as CCTV in police stations.

#### **12. Right Against Self-Incrimination**

*Section 36(11)* of the **Constitution** states that no person shall be compelled to testify against themselves. This mirrors international standards and ensures protection during police questioning and court proceedings.

#### **Remedies for Police Misconduct**

The courts have condemned police practices such as using excessive force or detaining relatives to compel suspects to appear. In *Gani Fawehinmi v. IGP (2002)*, the court ruled that such actions are unconstitutional.
