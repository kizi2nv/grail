            After over 8 years of litigation experience in
            multiple areas of the law, Tobi decided to narrow his 
            practice to focus exclusively on criminal defense.&nbsp;his commitment
             to his clients and his passion about righting the wrongs of a 
            flawed legal system, are only a few of the reasons why you will want him in your corner.
            With a soft voice and a kind demeanor, Tobi is the perfect example that you donâ€™t need to 
            be loud to be heard.
